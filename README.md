# Insurance-Management-System

CS 6100 -- Big Data Storage, Retrieval and Processing -- Fall 2021


#### Abstract
The application focus is to help insurance
companies with policy issuance by analyzing and measuring risks
based on telematics data and other factors. The manual risk
assessment methods will now be aided by our application by
providing data-driven reports. Predicting customer behavior and
intent is important for insurances to take safe business decisions
by minimizing the costs and ensuring high profitability. The data
for the insurance company will be provided by a telematic device
that is embedded in the moving asset (like a car, truck, etc.) and
transmits in real-time the speed, extreme turns, and braking
activities, distance traveled, etc. This data will be collected,
validated, cleaned, and trained to create a model that will help us
analyze customer behavior.

#### Project Goals
A. Machine Learning Model Generation

To build a Machine Learning model to predict the claim
status i.e. whether the person would claim the insurance based
on the telematics data and the traditional data.

B. User Interface

To present the Machine Learning model predictions and the
Data Visualization to insurance companies on a Full-stack
management system to visualize the driver behavior.
